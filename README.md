# DeepCSAT ‚Äì Predicting eCommerce Customer Satisfaction

**DeepCSAT** is a machine learning project focused on predicting customer satisfaction scores based on eCommerce customer support data. By analyzing various customer service interactions and feedback metrics, this project aims to assist businesses in identifying service improvement areas and proactively enhancing customer experience.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In the eCommerce space, maintaining high customer satisfaction is vital for brand loyalty and growth. This project uses historical customer service data to build a predictive model that estimates satisfaction scores based on behavioral and support-related features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` ‚Äì for data manipulation and analysis  
  - `numpy` ‚Äì for numerical operations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` ‚Äì for data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` ‚Äì for building and evaluating machine learning models  

## üìä Features
